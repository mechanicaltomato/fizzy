description: Explain how a specific part of Fizzy works
---

I'll explain how a specific part of the Fizzy codebase works.

I can explain:
- **Models** - Card, Board, User, Event, etc.
- **Controllers** - How requests are handled
- **Views** - How the UI is rendered
- **Concerns** - Shared behavior patterns
- **Background jobs** - Async processing
- **Multi-tenancy** - Account isolation
- **Turbo Streams** - Real-time updates
- **Stimulus controllers** - Client-side interactions
- **Authentication** - Magic link system
- **Events** - Audit trail and notifications
- **Search** - Sharded full-text search
- **Webhooks** - External integrations

What would you like me to explain? You can:
- Name a file (e.g., "app/models/card.rb")
- Name a feature (e.g., "how do notifications work")
- Name a concept (e.g., "multi-tenancy")
