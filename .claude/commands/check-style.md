description: Check code style with Rubocop
---

Check code style and conventions using Rubocop.

This will:
1. Run Rubocop style checker
2. Show any style violations
3. Optionally auto-fix safe violations

Would you like to:
- Check style only (`bundle exec rubocop`)
- Auto-fix safe issues (`bundle exec rubocop -a`)
- Auto-fix all issues (`bundle exec rubocop -A`) - use with caution
