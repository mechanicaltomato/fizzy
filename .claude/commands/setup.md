Set up or reset the Fizzy development environment.

Tasks to perform:
1. Install dependencies (bundle install)
2. Set up database (create, load schema)
3. Load fixture data for development
4. Prepare test database

Run `bin/setup` for initial setup, or `bin/setup --reset` to fully reset the database.

Execute the setup now?
